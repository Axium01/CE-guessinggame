Build a program that meets the following requirements:

Do not use user defined functions for this assignment.  Doing so shall receive a zero for the assignment.

Initializes a random number (see code fragment below) to a value between 1 and 10, inclusive.
Repeatedly asks the player to guess what the number is until the number is guessed.
If the guess is higher than the number, tell the player their guess is too high and that they should guess again.
If the guess is lower than the number, tell the player their guess is too low and that they should guess again.
If the guess is equal to the number, tell them:
That their guess was correct.
How many guesses they made.
Here's the code to create a random number:

  randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) +1;
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = randomNumber;
  console.log(randomNumber);
Required Output:

GuessingGame{Prompt1.JPG
says Guess a number between 1 and 10.
GuessingGame{Prompt2.JPG
says Guess was too low, guess again.
GuessingGameAlert.JPG
says You guessed it in 4 guesses!
 

For Full Credit: 

Code must run without errors.
App flow must be exactly as specified in the requirements.
User input shall be case insensitive.
Proper choice of decision control structure.
All if..else statements use a trailing else. 
UX must be exactly as required, text, punctuation, spelling.  
Exception is where the pictures above say, "This page says".  Some browsers may have different wording.
Bonus: Use nested loops to allow the game to repeat until the user decides not to play again.
